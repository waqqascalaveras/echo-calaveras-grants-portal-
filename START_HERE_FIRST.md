- ✅ Configuration files
- ✅ Deployment instructions
- ✅ No manual steps required (besides npm install)

**What IT needs:**
1. Node.js 18+ installed
2. Git installed
3. GitHub repository access
4. Run 3 commands:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start      # Test locally

## Deployment Options

### Option A: Request IT Installation
Ask IT to install:
1. Node.js from https://nodejs.org/ (LTS version)
2. Git from https://git-scm.com/

Then you can run everything yourself!

### Option B: Use Another Machine
Copy this entire folder to a computer where you have:
- Admin permissions or
- Node.js already installed

### Option C: Let IT Handle It
Give this folder to your IT department. They can:
1. Install dependencies (`npm install`)
2. Test locally (`npm start`)
3. Create GitHub repository
4. Deploy (`npm run deploy`)

## Questions?

**Q: Can I edit the code without Node.js?**  
A: Yes! Edit any file in a text editor. Changes take effect after `npm start` (which requires Node.js)

**Q: Will this work on a shared drive?**  
A: Yes! The entire folder can be copied anywhere. Node.js needs to be installed wherever you run it.

**Q: How much does hosting cost?**  
A: $0. GitHub Pages is free for public repositories.

**Q: Do we need a server?**  
A: No! This is a static site that runs entirely in the browser.

**Q: Can we customize it later?**  
A: Absolutely! All code is yours to modify.

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**You have a complete, production-ready React application!**

It just needs Node.js and Git to run. Everything else is done.

When you get those tools (on this or another machine), you're literally 3 commands away from having it live:

```bash
npm install  # Install packages
npm start    # Test it
npm run deploy  # Push it live
```

**Well done! 🎊**
